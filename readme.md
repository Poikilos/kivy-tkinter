# kivy-tkinter
Run some simple Kivy and KV code purely using the Tkinter framework!

There is much to do to implement features like Canvas and various
formats, so if you need a feature like that, chances are you will have
to code it yourself. Please submit changes in the form of a pull
request due to the amount of work necessary to make this project
"complete". I hope you enjoy this and contribute so that we can improve
this project together.

## Examples
Kivy programs need no code changes to utilize kivy-tkinter! However,
only so many features of Kivy are implemented. Known working Kivy
apps include:
